# TWITTER-SENTIMENTAL-ANALYSIS

## INTRODUCTION

This project focuses on building a Real-Time Twitter Sentiment Analysis System using Apache
Kafka and Apache Spark Streaming. The system enables the ingestion, processing, and analysis
of real-time tweet data to determine public sentiment in real-time. As social media platforms
like Twitter produce vast amounts of data, the challenge is to handle the continuous stream of
data while providing sentiment insights with minimal latency. The aim of this project is to
leverage big data tools like Kafka and Spark to process large-scale tweet data, apply natural
language processing (NLP) for sentiment analysis, and visualize the results in real time.

## Problem Statement
Twitter has become an important platform for gathering public opinion on various topics.
However, analyzing the sentiments expressed in real-time is a challenge due to the speed and
volume of data generation. Traditional batch processing systems introduce delays, making them
unsuitable for real-time decision-making. This project proposes a solution using Kafka for
real-time data ingestion and Spark Streaming for distributed processing, ensuring low latency
and scalability.
